# Chronicle Security Block

## Why use the Chronicle Security Looker Block?
**(1) Rapid Time To Value** - gain insights from your Chronicle data in minutes, not hours. The Chronicle Security Block includes pre-built dashboards and content focusing on the Data Ingestion Status and Health, context for Rule Detections, IOC matches and Alert prioritization, User Sign-ins, Asset Lookups, and Domain Lookups. Additionally, this data is organized into various Explorer views to enable adhoc querying and exploration of the Chronicle data.

**(2) Centralized Place for Analysis** -  No need to play the swivel chair game and go between different consoles, you can do self-service reporting for Chronicle data right here in Looker. Plus, you can combine your Chronicle data with other security and non-security data in your warehouse for end-to-end analysis.

**(3) Democratization of Data** - Security Analysts, managers and executives can easily build their own dashboards, and any user is equipped to ask and answer their own questions, save and share their own reports.
